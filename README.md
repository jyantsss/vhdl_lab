# Embedded System VHDL Lab Assignments

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to various VHDL lab assignments. This repository showcases solutions developed independently.

I've utilized GHDL for compiling the code and GTKWave for visualizing the waveforms. My development environment of choice is vim in ubuntu.

## How to Run

### Requirements:
- GHDL
- GTK Wave
- code editor

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jyantsss/vhdl_lab.git
    cd vhdl_lab
    ```

2. **Steps to Follow:**
   - Install GHDL
   - Install GTKWave
   - Install make tools

3. **After Installation:**
   Navigate to the specific file you wish to observe the output for, for example:
   cd upcounter
Run the Makefile:
make
This will generate a file named result.vcd.

To observe the output, run:
gtkwave result.vcd
